# Arduino Midi Controller and Step Sequencer


## Ideas

* set channel instrument from pad mode (function key? long press?)
* don't rewind if already on step 1
* show channel instrument when toggling note (currently only channel is displayed)
* tap tempo
* record from pad mode
* save state to eeprom
* swing
* channel volume
